			<h1>Hi there!</h1>
			<p>
      Iâ€™m Ren Blanding, Designer II at Keurig Dr Pepper and working on the coffee side of the business. My specializations are in UI Design for physical products, as well as design systems for e-commerce sites and apps. When it comes to design, my passion is delivering insights and work that put people first, both for end users and my teammates. As you can see by this website, I'm not afraid of a little code either, and I love working with developers.
